Fixtures used for initial data loading & testing go here.

When creating fixtures use the following command:
`python Q/manage.py dumpdata auth.User sites.Site questionnaire --indent=4 > Q/questionnaire/fixtures/q_testdata.json`

NOTE: THE RESULTANT FILE WILL CONTAIN MODELS IN A RANDOM ORDER
NOTE: (EVEN THOUGH THAT BUG WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN FIXED IN DJANGO 1.8)
NOTE: YOU MAY HAVE TO RE-ORDER MODELS FOR THE TESTS TO WORK
NOTE: THIS CAN BE DONE USING THE "sort_fixtures.py" SCRIPT
